# StockApp
My application is a stock trading platform that enables users to buy and sell stocks while providing real-time stock price information. The backend is built using ASP.NET MVC, EF Core, and MS SQL for data management, while the front end is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap to create a user-friendly and responsive interface.
